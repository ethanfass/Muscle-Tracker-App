# Muscle Tracker App

A React application for planning workouts and visualizing muscle group training volume on a body diagram. Users can select exercises, see per-muscle totals, save and load workouts, switch between dark and light mode, and view general set-volume recommendations.

## Features

- Search and select exercises from a predefined list  
- Automatically calculate training volume per muscle group  
- Interactive body diagram with color-coded muscle activation  
- Save and load named workouts within the session  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Guidance on recommended sets per workout  
- Option to show all muscles or only active muscles

## How It Works

- Each exercise maps to one or more muscle groups with weighted contributions  
  *(e.g., Bench Press â†’ chest: 1, delts: 0.25, triceps: 0.25)*  
- The app aggregates weights for all selected exercises to produce per-muscle totals  
- The body diagram uses a gradient scale to represent volume intensity  
- Saved workouts are stored in component state (not persistent across refresh)

## Technology

- React (Hooks and state management)  
- SVG overlays for the muscle diagram  
- CSS for layout and styling
